# Breadsheet: A scheduling tool for homemade bread and pizza

## How is this different from a recipe?
Breadsheet adds a handy scheduling tool to your recipes, helping you fit long recipes into your day.

Most bread recipes take considerably longer than your average dinner recipe.  Typically an _order of magnitude_ longer, often with hours of downtime between steps.  And that downtime can vary wildly depending on ambient temperature, humidity, etc.

Bread recipes identify windows of time when the dough displays certain properties.  You then perform an action, then leave the dough to rest until the next window arrives.  And since some of these recipes are be measured in _days_ (I'm looking at you, sourdough), planning your life around these steps can be challenging.

Breadsheet helps you visualize when each step of a recipe should start (or finish), allowing for easy adjustments to timing windows so they fit into your schedule.

## Got an example?
Suppose you're invited to a picnic on Saturday afternoon. Captivated by your exemplary breadmaking skills over the years, the group asks you to bake a fresh loaf of sourdough.

Although you love sourdough, you're also aware it can be challenging to properly schedule.  There are many time-sensitive steps in this process with a fair bit of downtime throughout.  You may need to start as early as _Thursday morning_ depending the current state & strength of your [levain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough#Starter).

But wait, this is `$(DateJoke).getCurrentYear()`.  There _must_ be a better way!

Enter [Breadsheet](http://breadsheet.com): A scheduling tool that calculates the start & finish times for each step within your recipe, and makes it easy to adjust when those steps should start or finish.  Focus on the bread; leave the scheduling to [Breadsheet](http://breadsheet.com).
